# Music Recommendation System
In the age of digital streaming services and an abundance of movie options at my fingertips, the task of finding the perfect movie to watch can often feel overwhelming. That's why I decided to take on a project called "Movie Recommendations using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNNs)" to simplify this process and provide personalized movie recommendations based on my input.

To accomplish this, I utilized the <b>TMDb 5000 Movies</b> dataset, which offers a vast collection of movie information, including details such as genres, directors, actors, and user ratings. With this dataset, I was able to build a robust recommendation system that takes my favorite movie as input and returns a curated list of 10 similar movies.

The <b>k-Nearest Neighbors</b> algorithm is a well-established technique in machine learning that measures the similarity between data points in a high-dimensional space. In my case, each movie is represented as a vector of attributes, and I calculate the <b>Cosine similarity</b> between these vectors to identify the nearest neighbors. This approach ensures that my recommendations are not solely based on genres or actors but consider a broader spectrum of factors, resulting in more accurate and diverse suggestions.

My project represents a fusion of data science and the world of entertainment, demonstrating the immense potential of machine learning to enhance my daily life by making movie selection a more enjoyable and hassle-free experience.
