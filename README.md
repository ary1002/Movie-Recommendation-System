# Movie-Recommendation-System
In the age of digital streaming services and an abundance of movie options at our fingertips, the task of finding the perfect movie to watch can often feel overwhelming. Imagine a solution that can simplify this process, a system that can provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their input.The world of machine learning and data science has revolutionized how we approach everyday challenges, and movie recommendation systems have become a fascinating and valuable application of these technologies.This is precisely the goal of our project, "Movie Recommendations using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNNs)".

To accomplish this, we utilized the <b>TMDb 5000 Movies dataset</b>, which offers a vast collection of movie information, including details such as genres, directors, actors, and user ratings. By leveraging this dataset, we were able to build a robust recommendation system that takes a user's favorite movie as input and returns a curated list of 10 similar movies.

The <b> k-Nearest Neighbors </b> algorithm is a well-established technique in machine learning that measures the similarity between data points in a high-dimensional space. In our case, each movie is represented as a vector of attributes, and we calculate the <b>Cosine similarity</b> between these vectors to identify the nearest neighbors. This approach ensures that our recommendations are not solely based on genres or actors but consider a broader spectrum of factors, resulting in more accurate and diverse suggestions.

Our project represents a fusion of data science and the world of entertainment, demonstrating the immense potential of machine learning to enhance our daily lives.
